<h1>THE DIARY OF A GOOSE GIRL</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p>THORNYCROFT FARM, near Barbury Green, July 1, 190-.</p>
<p>In alluding to myself as a Goose Girl, I am using only the most modest
of my titles; for I am also a poultry-maid, a tender of Belgian hares
and rabbits, and a shepherdess; but I particularly fancy the r&ocirc;le
of Goose Girl, because it recalls the German fairy tales of my early
youth, when I always yearned, but never hoped, to be precisely what
I now am.</p>
<p>As I was jolting along these charming Sussex roads the other day,
a fat buff pony and a tippy cart being my manner of progression, I chanced
upon the village of Barbury Green.</p>
<p>One glance was enough for any woman, who, having eyes to see, could
see with them; but I made assurance doubly sure by driving about a little,
struggling to conceal my new-born passion from the stable-boy who was
my escort.&nbsp; Then, it being high noon of a cloudless day, I descended
from the trap and said to the astonished yokel: &ldquo;You may go back
to the Hydropathic; I am spending a month or two here.&nbsp; Wait a
moment&mdash;I&rsquo;ll send a message, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I then scribbled a word or two to those having me in custody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very tired of people,&rdquo; the note ran, &ldquo;and
want to rest myself by living a while with things.&nbsp; Address me
(if you must) at Barbury Green post-office, or at all events send me
a box of simple clothing there&mdash;nothing but shirts and skirts,
please.&nbsp; I cannot forget that I am only twenty miles from Oxenbridge
(though it might be one hundred and twenty, which is the reason I adore
it), but I rely upon you to keep an honourable distance yourselves,
and not to divulge my place of retreat to others, especially to&mdash;you
know whom!&nbsp; Do not pursue me.&nbsp; I will never be taken alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having cut, thus, the cable that bound me to civilisation, and having
seen the buff pony and the dazed yokel disappear in a cloud of dust,
I looked about me with what Stevenson calls a &ldquo;fine, dizzy, muddle-headed
joy,&rdquo; the joy of a successful rebel or a liberated serf.&nbsp;
Plenty of money in my purse&mdash;that was unromantic, of course, but
it simplified matters&mdash;and nine hours of daylight remaining in
which to find a lodging.</p>
<p>The village is one of the oldest, and I am sure it must be one of
the quaintest, in England.&nbsp; It is too small to be printed on the
map (an honour that has spoiled more than one Arcadia), so pray do not
look there, but just believe in it, and some day you may be rewarded
by driving into it by chance, as I did, and feel the same Columbus thrill
running, like an electric current, through your veins.&nbsp; I withhold
specific geographical information in order that you may not miss that
Columbus thrill, which comes too seldom in a world of railroads.</p>
<p>The Green is in the very centre of Barbury village, and all civic,
political, family, and social life converges there, just at the public
duck-pond&mdash;a wee, sleepy lake with a slope of grass-covered stones
by which the ducks descend for their swim.</p>
<p>The houses are set about the Green like those in a toy village.&nbsp;
They are of old brick, with crumpled, up-and-down roofs of deep-toned
red, and tufts of stonecrop growing from the eaves.&nbsp; Diamond-paned
windows, half open, admit the sweet summer air; and as for the gardens
in front, it would seem as if the inhabitants had nothing to do but
work in them, there is such a riotous profusion of colour and bloom.&nbsp;
To add to the effect, there are always pots of flowers hanging from
the trees, blue flax and yellow myrtle; and cages of Java sparrows and
canaries singing joyously, as well they may in such a paradise.</p>
<p>The shops are idyllic, too, as if Nature had seized even the man
of trade and made him subservient to her designs.&nbsp; The general
draper&rsquo;s, where I fitted myself out for a day or two quite easily,
is set back in a tangle of poppies and sweet peas, Madonna lilies and
Canterbury bells.&nbsp; The shop itself has a gay awning, and what do
you think the draper has suspended from it, just as a picturesque suggestion
to the passer-by?&nbsp; Suggestion I call it, because I should blush
to use the word advertisement in describing anything so dainty and decorative.&nbsp;
Well, then, garlands of shoes, if you please!&nbsp; Baby bootlets of
bronze; tiny ankle-ties in yellow, blue, and scarlet kid; glossy patent-leather
pumps shining in the sun, with festoons of slippers at the corners,
flowery slippers in imitation Berlin wool-work.&nbsp; If you make this
picture in your mind&rsquo;s-eye, just add a window above the awning,
and over the fringe of marigolds in the window-box put the draper&rsquo;s
wife dancing a rosy-cheeked baby.&nbsp; Alas! my words are only black
and white, I fear, and this picture needs a palette drenched in primary
colours.</p>
<p>Along the street, a short distance, is the old watchmaker&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Set in the hedge at the gate is a glass case with <i>Multum in Parvo</i>
painted on the woodwork.&nbsp; Within, a little stand of trinkets revolves
slowly; as slowly, I imagine, as the current of business in that quiet
street.&nbsp; The house stands a trifle back and is covered thickly
with ivy, while over the entrance-door of the shop is a great round
clock set in a green frame of clustering vine.&nbsp; The hands pointed
to one when I passed the watchmaker&rsquo;s garden with its thicket
of fragrant lavender and its murmuring bees; so I went in to the sign
of the &ldquo;Strong i&rsquo; the Arm&rdquo; for some cold luncheon,
determining to patronise &ldquo;The Running Footman&rdquo; at the very
next opportunity.&nbsp; Neither of these inns is starred by Baedeker,
and this fact adds the last touch of enchantment to the picture.</p>
<p>The landlady at the &ldquo;Strong i&rsquo; the Arm&rdquo; stabbed
me in the heart by telling me that there were no apartments to let in
the village, and that she had no private sitting-room in the inn; but
she speedily healed the wound by saying that I might be accommodated
at one of the farm-houses in the vicinity.&nbsp; Did I object to a farm-&rsquo;ouse?&nbsp;
Then she could cheerfully recommend the Evan&rsquo;s farm, only &rsquo;alf
a mile away.&nbsp; She &rsquo;ad understood from Miss Phoebe Evan, who
sold her poultry, that they would take one lady lodger if she didn&rsquo;t
wish much waiting upon.</p>
<p>In my present mood I was in search of the strenuous life, and eager
to wait, rather than to be waited upon; so I walked along the edge of
the Green, wishing that some mentally unbalanced householder would take
a sudden fancy to me and ask me to come in and lodge awhile.&nbsp; I
suppose these families live under their roofs of peach-blow tiles, in
the midst of their blooming gardens, for a guinea a week or thereabouts;
yet if they &ldquo;undertook&rdquo; me (to use their own phrase), the
bill for my humble meals and bed would be at least double that.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know that I blame them; one should have proper compensation
for admitting a world-stained lodger into such an Eden.</p>
<p>When I was searching for rooms a week ago, I chanced upon a pretty
cottage where the woman had sometimes let apartments.&nbsp; She showed
me the premises and asked me if I would mind taking my meals in her
own dining-room, where I could be served privately at certain hours:
and, since she had but the one sitting-room, would I allow her to go
on using it occasionally? also, if I had no special preference, would
I take the second-sized bedroom and leave her in possession of the largest
one, which permitted her to have the baby&rsquo;s crib by her bedside?&nbsp;
She thought I should be quite as comfortable, and it was her opinion
that in making arrangements with lodgers, it was a good plan not to
&ldquo;bryke up the &rsquo;ome any more than was necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bryke up the &rsquo;ome!&rdquo;&nbsp; That is seemingly the
malignant purpose with which I entered Barbury Green.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>July 4th.</p>
<p>Enter the family of Thornycroft Farm, of which I am already a member
in good and regular standing.</p>
<p>I introduce Mrs. Heaven first, for she is a self-saturated person
who would never forgive the insult should she receive any lower place.</p>
<p>She welcomed me with the statement: &ldquo;We do not take lodgers
here, nor boarders; no lodgers, nor boarders, but we do occasionally
admit paying guests, those who look as if they would appreciate the
quietude of the plyce and be willing as you might say to remunerate
according.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not mind at this particular juncture what I was called, so
long as the epithet was comparatively unobjectionable, so I am a paying
guest, therefore, and I expect to pay handsomely for the handsome appellation.&nbsp;
Mrs. Heaven is short and fat; she fills her dress as a pin-cushion fills
its cover; she wears a cap and apron, and she is so full of platitudes
that she would have burst had I not appeared as a providential outlet
for them.&nbsp; Her accent is not of the farm, but of the town, and
smacks wholly of the marts of trade.&nbsp; She is repetitious, too,
as well as platitudinous.&nbsp; &ldquo;I &rsquo;ope if there&rsquo;s
anythink you require you will let us know, let us know,&rdquo; she says
several times each day; and whenever she enters my sitting-room she
prefaces her conversation with the remark: &ldquo;I trust you are finding
it quiet here, miss?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the quietude of the plyce that
is its charm, yes, the quietude.&nbsp; And yet&rdquo; (she dribbles
on) &ldquo;it wears on a body after a while, miss.&nbsp; I often go
into Woodmucket to visit one of my sons just for the noise, simply for
the noise, miss, for nothink else in the world but the noise.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s nothink like noise for soothing nerves that is worn threadbare
with the quietude, miss, or at least that&rsquo;s my experience; and
yet to a strynger the quietude of the plyce is its charm, undoubtedly
its chief charm; and that is what our paying guests always say, although
our charges are somewhat higher than other plyces.&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s
anythink you require, miss, I &rsquo;ope you&rsquo;ll mention it.&nbsp;
There is not a commodious assortment in Barbury Green, but we can always
send the pony to Woodmucket in case of urgency.&nbsp; Our paying guest
last summer was a Mrs. Pollock, and she was by way of having sudden
fancies.&nbsp; Young and unmarried though you are, miss, I think you
will tyke my meaning without my speaking plyner?&nbsp; Well, at six
o&rsquo;clock of a rainy afternoon, she was seized with an unaccountable
desire for vegetable marrows, and Mr. &rsquo;Eaven put the pony in the
cart and went to Woodmucket for them, which is a great advantage to
be so near a town and yet &rsquo;ave the quietude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Heaven is merged, like Mr. Jellyby, in the more shining qualities
of his wife.&nbsp; A line of description is too long for him.&nbsp;
Indeed, I can think of no single word brief enough, at least in English.&nbsp;
The Latin &ldquo;nil&rdquo; will do, since no language is rich in words
of less than three letters.&nbsp; He is nice, kind, bald, timid, thin,
and so colourless that he can scarcely be discerned save in a strong
light.&nbsp; When Mrs. Heaven goes out into the orchard in search of
him, I can hardly help calling from my window, &ldquo;Bear a trifle
to the right, Mrs. Heaven&mdash;now to the left&mdash;just in front
of you now&mdash;if you put out your hands you will touch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoebe, aged seventeen, is the daughter of the house.&nbsp; She is
virtuous, industrious, conscientious, and singularly destitute of physical
charm.&nbsp; She is more than plain; she looks as if she had been planned
without any definite purpose in view, made of the wrong materials, been
badly put together, and never properly finished off; but &ldquo;plain&rdquo;
after all is a relative word.&nbsp; Many a plain girl has been married
for her beauty; and now and then a beauty, falling under a cold eye,
has been thought plain.</p>
<p>Phoebe has her compensations, for she is beloved by, and reciprocates
the passion of, the Woodmancote carrier, Woodmucket being the English
manner of pronouncing the place of his abode.&nbsp; If he &ldquo;carries&rdquo;
as energetically for the great public as he fetches for Phoebe, then
he must be a rising and a prosperous man.&nbsp; He brings her daily,
wild strawberries, cherries, birds&rsquo; nests, peacock feathers, sea-shells,
green hazel-nuts, samples of hens&rsquo; food, or bouquets of wilted
field flowers tied together tightly and held with a large, moist, loving
hand.&nbsp; He has fine curly hair of sandy hue, which forms an aureole
on his brow, and a reddish beard, which makes another inverted aureole
to match, round his chin.&nbsp; One cannot look at him, especially when
the sun shines through him, without thinking how lovely he would be
if stuffed and set on wheels, with a little string to drag him about.</p>
<p>Phoebe confided to me that she was on the eve of loving the postman
when the carrier came across her horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t do to be too hysty, does it, miss?&rdquo;
she asked me as we were weeding the onion bed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was to
give the postman his answer on the Monday night, and it was on the Monday
morning that Mr. Gladwish made his first trip here as carrier.&nbsp;
I may say I never wyvered from that moment, and no more did he.&nbsp;
When I think how near I came to promising the postman it gives me a
turn.&rdquo;&nbsp; (I can understand that, for I once met the man I
nearly promised years before to marry, and we both experienced such
a sense of relief at being free instead of bound that we came near falling
in love for sheer joy.)</p>
<p>The last and most important member of the household is the Square
Baby.&nbsp; His name is Albert Edward, and he is really five years old
and no baby at all; but his appearance on this planet was in the nature
of a complete surprise to all parties concerned, and he is spoiled accordingly.&nbsp;
He has a square head and jaw, square shoulders, square hands and feet.&nbsp;
He is red and white and solid and stolid and slow-witted, as the young
of his class commonly are, and will make a bulwark of the nation in
course of time, I should think; for England has to produce a few thousand
such square babies every year for use in the colonies and in the standing
army.&nbsp; Albert Edward has already a military gait, and when he has
acquired a habit of obedience at all comparable with his power of command,
he will be able to take up the white man&rsquo;s burden with distinguished
success.&nbsp; Meantime I can never look at him without marvelling how
the English climate can transmute bacon and eggs, tea and the solid
household loaf into such radiant roses and lilies as bloom upon his
cheeks and lips.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>July 8th.</p>
<p>Thornycroft is by way of being a small poultry farm.</p>
<p>In reaching it from Barbury Green, you take the first left-hand road,
go till you drop, and there you are.</p>
<p>It reminds me of my &ldquo;grandmother&rsquo;s farm at Older.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Did you know the song when you were a child?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>My grandmother had a very fine farm<br />
&lsquo;Way down in the fields of Older.<br />
With a cluck-cluck here,<br />
And a cluck-cluck there,<br />
Here and there a cluck-cluck,<br />
Cluck-cluck here and there,<br />
Down in the fields at Older.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It goes on for ever by the simple subterfuge of changing a few words
in each verse.</p>
<blockquote><p>My grandmother had a very fine farm<br />
&lsquo;Way down in the fields of Older.<br />
With a quack-quack here,<br />
And a quack-quack there,<br />
Here and there a quack-quack,<br />
Quack-quack here and there,<br />
Down in the fields at Older.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is followed by the gobble-gobble, moo-moo, baa-baa, etc., as
long as the laureate&rsquo;s imagination and the infant&rsquo;s breath
hold good.&nbsp; The tune is pretty, and I do not know, or did not,
when I was young, a more fascinating lyric.</p>
<p>Thornycroft House must have belonged to a country gentleman once
upon a time, or to more than one; men who built on a bit here and there
once in a hundred years, until finally we have this charmingly irregular
and dilapidated whole.&nbsp; You go up three steps into Mrs. Heaven&rsquo;s
room, down two into mine, while Phoebe&rsquo;s is up in a sort of turret
with long, narrow lattices opening into the creepers.&nbsp; There are
crooked little stair-cases, passages that branch off into other passages
and lead nowhere in particular; I can&rsquo;t think of a better house
in which to play hide and seek on a wet day.&nbsp; In front, what was
once, doubtless, a green, is cut up into greens; to wit, a vegetable
garden, where the onions, turnips, and potatoes grow cosily up to the
very door-sill; the utilitarian aspect of it all being varied by some
scarlet-runners and a scattering of poppies on either side of the path.</p>
<p>The Belgian hares have their habitation in a corner fifty feet distant;
one large enclosure for poultry lies just outside the sweetbrier hedge;
the others, with all the houses and coops, are in the meadow at the
back, where also our tumbler pigeons are kept.</p>
<p>Phoebe attends to the poultry; it is her department.&nbsp; Mr. Heaven
has neither the force nor the <i>finesse</i> required, and the gentle
reader who thinks these qualities unneeded in so humble a calling has
only to spend a few days at Thornycroft to be convinced.&nbsp; Mrs.
Heaven would be of use, but she is dressing the Square Baby in the morning
and putting him to bed at night just at the hours when the feathered
young things are undergoing the same operation.</p>
<p>A Goose Girl, like a poet, is sometimes born, sometimes otherwise.&nbsp;
I am of the born variety.&nbsp; No training was necessary; I put my
head on my pillow as a complicated product of modern civilisation on
a Tuesday night, and on a Wednesday morning I awoke as a Goose Girl.</p>
<p>My destiny slumbered during the day, but at eight o&rsquo;clock I
heard a terrific squawking in the direction of the duck-ponds, and,
aimlessly drifting in that direction, I came upon Phoebe trying to induce
ducks and drakes, geese and ganders, to retire for the night.&nbsp;
They have to be driven into enclosures behind fences of wire netting,
fastened into little rat-proof boxes, or shut into separate coops, so
as to be safe from their natural enemies, the rats and foxes; which,
obeying, I suppose, the law of supply and demand, abound in this neighbourhood.&nbsp;
The old ganders are allowed their liberty, being of such age, discretion,
sagacity, and pugnacity that they can be trusted to fight their own
battles.</p>
<p>The intelligence of hens, though modest, is of such an order that
it prompts them to go to bed at a virtuous hour of their own accord;
but ducks and geese have to be materially assisted, or I believe they
would roam till morning.&nbsp; Never did small boy detest and resist
being carried off to his nursery as these dullards, young and old, detest
and resist being driven to theirs.&nbsp; Whether they suffer from insomnia,
or nightmare, or whether they simply prefer the sweet air of liberty
(and death) to the odour of captivity and the coop, I have no means
of knowing.</p>
<p>Phoebe stood by one of the duck-ponds, a long pole in her hand, and
a helpless expression in that doughlike countenance of hers, where aimless
contours and features unite to make a kind of facial blur.&nbsp; (What
does the carrier see in it?)&nbsp; The pole was not long enough to reach
the ducks, and Phoebe&rsquo;s method lacked spirit and adroitness, so
that it was natural, perhaps, that they refused to leave the water,
the evening being warm, with an uncommon fine sunset.</p>
<p>I saw the situation at once and ran to meet it with a glow of interest
and anticipation.&nbsp; If there is anything in the world I enjoy, it
is making somebody do something that he doesn&rsquo;t want to do; and
if, when victory perches upon my banner, the somebody can be brought
to say that he ought to have done it without my making him, that adds
the unforgettable touch to pleasure, though seldom, alas! does it happen.&nbsp;
Then ensued the delightful and stimulating hour that has now become
a feature of the day; an hour in which the remembrance of the table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te
dinner at the Hydro, going on at identically the same time, only stirs
me to a keener joy and gratitude.</p>
<p>The ducks swim round in circles, hide under the willows, and attempt
to creep into the rat-holes in the banks, a stupidity so crass that
it merits instant death, which it somehow always escapes.&nbsp; Then
they come out in couples and waddle under the wrong fence into the lower
meadow, fly madly under the tool-house, pitch blindly in with the sitting
hens, and out again in short order, all the time quacking and squawking,
honking and hissing like a bewildered orchestra.&nbsp; By dint of splashing
the water with poles, throwing pebbles, beating the shrubs at the pond&rsquo;s
edges, &ldquo;shooing&rdquo; frantically with our skirts, crawling beneath
bars to head them off, and prodding them from under bushes to urge them
on, we finally get the older ones out of the water and the younger ones
into some sort of relation to their various retreats; but, owing to
their lack of geography, hatred of home, and general recalcitrancy,
they none of them turn up in the right place and have to be sorted out.&nbsp;
We uncover the top of the little house, or the enclosure as it may be,
or reach in at the door, and, seizing the struggling victim, drag him
forth and take him where he should have had the wit to go in the first
instance.&nbsp; The weak ones get in with the strong and are in danger
of being trampled; two May goslings that look almost full-grown have
run into a house with a brood of ducklings a week old.&nbsp; There are
twenty-seven crowded into one coop, five in another, nineteen in another;
the gosling with one leg has to come out, and the duckling threatened
with the gapes; their place is with the &ldquo;invaleeds,&rdquo; as
Phoebe calls them, but they never learn the location of the hospital,
nor have the slightest scruple about spreading contagious diseases.</p>
<p>Finally, when we have separated and sorted exhaustively, an operation
in which Phoebe shows a delicacy of discrimination and a fearlessness
of attack amounting to genius, we count the entire number and find several
missing.&nbsp; Searching for their animate or inanimate bodies, we &ldquo;scoop&rdquo;
one from under the tool-house, chance upon two more who are being harried
and pecked by the big geese in the lower meadow, and discover one sailing
by himself in solitary splendour in the middle of the deserted pond,
a look of evil triumph in his bead-like eye.&nbsp; Still we lack one
young duckling, and he at length is found dead by the hedge.&nbsp; A
rat has evidently seized him and choked him at a single throttle, but
in such haste that he has not had time to carry away the tiny body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor think!&rdquo; says Phoebe tearfully; &ldquo;it looks
as if it was &rsquo;it with some kind of a wepping.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know whatever to do with the rats, they&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; that
fearocious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before I was admitted into daily contact with the living goose (my
previous intercourse with him having been carried on when gravy and
stuffing obscured his true personality), I thought him a very Dreyfus
among fowls, a sorely slandered bird, to whom justice had never been
done; for even the gentle Darwin is hard upon him.&nbsp; My opinion
is undergoing some slight modifications, but I withhold judgment at
present, hoping that some of the follies, faults, vagaries, and limitations
that I observe in Phoebe&rsquo;s geese may be due to Phoebe&rsquo;s
educational methods, which were, before my advent, those of the darkest
ages.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>July 9th.</p>
<p>By the time the ducks and geese are incarcerated for the night, the
reasonable, sensible, practical-minded hens&mdash;especially those whose
mentality is increased and whose virtue is heightened by the responsibilities
of motherhood&mdash;have gone into their own particular rat-proof boxes,
where they are waiting in a semi-somnolent state to have the wire doors
closed, the bricks set against them, and the bits of sacking flung over
the tops to keep out the draught.&nbsp; We have a great many young families,
both ducklings and chicks, but we have no duck mothers at present.&nbsp;
The variety of bird which Phoebe seems to have bred during the past
year may be called the New Duck, with certain radical ideas about woman&rsquo;s
sphere.&nbsp; What will happen to Thornycroft if we develop a New Hen
and a New Cow, my imagination fails to conceive.&nbsp; There does not
seem to be the slightest danger for the moment, however, and our hens
lay and sit and sit and lay as if laying and sitting were the twin purposes
of life.</p>
<p>The nature of the hen seems to broaden with the duties of maternity,
but I think myself that we presume a little upon her amiability and
natural motherliness.&nbsp; It is one thing to desire a family of one&rsquo;s
own, to lay eggs with that idea in view, to sit upon them three long
weeks and hatch out and bring up a nice brood of chicks.&nbsp; It must
be quite another to have one&rsquo;s eggs abstracted day by day and
eaten by a callous public, the nest filled with deceitful substitutes,
and at the end of a dull and weary period of hatching to bring into
the world another person&rsquo;s children&mdash;children, too, of the
wrong size, the wrong kind of bills and feet, and, still more subtle
grievance, the wrong kind of instincts, leading them to a dangerous
aquatic career, one which the mother may not enter to guide, guard,
and teach; one on the brink of which she must ever stand, uttering dryshod
warnings which are never heeded.&nbsp; They grow used to this strange
order of things after a bit, it is true, and are less anxious and excited.&nbsp;
When the duck-brood returns safely again and again from what the hen-mother
thinks will prove a watery grave, she becomes accustomed to the situation,
I suppose.&nbsp; I find that at night she stands by the pond for what
she considers a decent, self-respecting length of time, calling the
ducklings out of the water; then, if they refuse to come, the mother
goes off to bed and leaves them to Providence, or Phoebe.</p>
<p>The brown hen that we have named Cornelia is the best mother, the
one who waits longest and most patiently for the web-footed Gracchi
to finish their swim.</p>
<p>When a chick is taken out of the incubytor (as Phoebe calls it) and
refused by all the other hens, Cornelia generally accepts it, though
she had twelve of her own when we began using her as an orphan asylum.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wings are made to stretch,&rdquo; she seems to say cheerfully,
and with a kind glance of her round eye she welcomes the wanderer and
the outcast.&nbsp; She even tended for a time the offspring of an absent-minded,
light-headed pheasant who flew over a four-foot wall and left her young
behind her to starve; it was not a New Pheasant, either; for the most
conservative and old-fashioned of her tribe occasionally commits domestic
solecisms of this sort.</p>
<p>There is no telling when, where, or how the maternal instinct will
assert itself.&nbsp; Among our Thornycroft cats is a certain Mrs. Greyskin.&nbsp;
She had not been seen for many days, and Mrs. Heaven concluded that
she had hidden herself somewhere with a family of kittens; but as the
supply of that article with us more than equals the demand, we had not
searched for her with especial zeal.</p>
<p>The other day Mrs. Greyskin appeared at the dairy door, and when
she had been fed Phoebe and I followed her stealthily, from a distance.&nbsp;
She walked slowly about as if her mind were quite free from harassing
care, and finally approached a deserted cow-house where there was a
great mound of straw.&nbsp; At this moment she caught sight of us and
turned in another direction to throw us off the scent.&nbsp; We persevered
in our intention of going into her probable retreat, and were cautiously
looking for some sign of life in the haymow, when we heard a soft cackle
and a ruffling of plumage.&nbsp; Coming closer to the sound we saw a
black hen brooding a nest, her bright bead eyes turning nervously from
side to side; and, coaxed out from her protecting wings by youthful
curiosity, came four kittens, eyes wide open, warm, happy, ready for
sport!</p>
<p>The sight was irresistible, and Phoebe ran for Mr. and Mrs. Heaven
and the Square Baby.&nbsp; Mother Hen was not to be embarrassed or daunted,
even if her most sacred feelings were regarded in the light of a cheap
entertainment.&nbsp; She held her ground while one of the kits slid
up and down her glossy back, and two others, more timid, crept underneath
her breast, only daring to put out their pink noses!&nbsp; We retired
then for very shame and met Mrs. Greyskin in the doorway.&nbsp; This
should have thickened the plot, but there is apparently no rivalry nor
animosity between the co-mothers.&nbsp; We watch them every day now,
through a window in the roof.&nbsp; Mother Greyskin visits the kittens
frequently, lies down beside the home nest, and gives them their dinner.&nbsp;
While this is going on Mother Blackwing goes modestly away for a bite,
a sup, and a little exercise, returning to the kittens when the cat
leaves them.&nbsp; It is pretty to see her settle down over the four,
fat, furry dumplings, and they seem to know no difference in warmth
or comfort, whichever mother is brooding them; while, as their eyes
have been open for a week, it can no longer be called a blind error
on their part.</p>
<p>When we have closed all our small hen-nurseries for the night, there
is still the large house inhabited by the thirty-two full-grown chickens
which Phoebe calls the broilers.&nbsp; I cannot endure the term, and
will not use it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now for the April chicks,&rdquo; I say
every evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the broilers?&rdquo; asks Phoebe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the big April chicks,&rdquo; say I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, them are the broilers,&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>But is it not disagreeable enough to be a broiler when one&rsquo;s
time comes, without having the gridiron waved in one&rsquo;s face for
weeks beforehand?</p>
<p>The April chicks are all lively and desirous of seeing the world
as thoroughly as possible before going to roost or broil.&nbsp; As a
general thing, we find in the large house sixteen young fowls of the
contemplative, flavourless, resigned-to-the-inevitable variety; three
more (the same three every night) perch on the roof and are driven down;
four (always the same four) cling to the edge of the open door, waiting
to fly off, but not in, when you attempt to close it; nine huddle together
on a place in the grass about forty feet distant, where a small coop
formerly stood in the prehistoric ages.&nbsp; This small coop was one
in which they lodged for a fortnight when they were younger, and when
those absolutely indelible impressions are formed of which we read in
educational maxims.&nbsp; It was taken away long since, but the nine
loyal (or stupid) Casabiancas cling to the sacred spot where its foundations
rested; they accordingly have to be caught and deposited bodily in the
house, and this requires strategy, as they note our approach from a
considerable distance.</p>
<p>Finally all are housed but two, the little white cock and the black
pullet, who are still impish and of a wandering mind.&nbsp; Though headed
off in every direction, they fly into the hedges and hide in the underbrush.&nbsp;
We beat the hedge on the other side, but with no avail.&nbsp; We dive
into the thicket of wild roses, sweetbrier, and thistles on our hands
and knees, coming out with tangled hair, scratched noses, and no hens.&nbsp;
Then, when all has been done that human ingenuity can suggest, Phoebe
goes to her late supper and I do sentry-work.&nbsp; I stroll to a safe
distance, and, sitting on one of the rat-proof boxes, watch the bushes
with an eagle eye.&nbsp; Five minutes go by, ten, fifteen; and then
out steps the white cock, stealthily tiptoeing toward the home into
which he refused to go at our instigation.&nbsp; In a moment out creeps
the obstinate little beast of a black pullet from the opposite clump.&nbsp;
The wayward pair meet at their own door, which I have left open a few
inches.&nbsp; When all is still I walk gently down the field, and, warned
by previous experiences, approach the house from behind.&nbsp; I draw
the door to softly and quickly; but not so quickly that the evil-minded
and suspicious black pullet hasn&rsquo;t time to spring out, with a
make-believe squawk of fright&mdash;that induces three other blameless
chickens to fly down from their perches and set the whole flock in a
flutter.&nbsp; Then I fall from grace and call her a Broiler; and when,
after some minutes of hot pursuit, I catch her by falling over her in
the corner by the goose-pen, I address her as a fat, juicy Broiler with
parsley butter and a bit of bacon.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>July 10th.</p>
<p>At ten thirty or so in the morning the cackling begins.&nbsp; I wonder
exactly what it means!&nbsp; Have the forest-lovers who listen so respectfully
to, and interpret so exquisitely, the notes of birds&mdash;have none
of them made psychological investigations of the hen cackle?&nbsp; Can
it be simple elation?&nbsp; One could believe that of the first few
eggs, but a hen who has laid two or three hundred can hardly feel the
same exuberant pride and joy daily.&nbsp; Can it be the excitement incident
to successful achievement?&nbsp; Hardly, because the task is so extremely
simple.&nbsp; Eggs are more or less alike; a little larger or smaller,
a trifle whiter or browner; and almost sure to be quite right as to
details; that is, the big end never gets confused with the little end,
they are always ovoid and never spherical, and the yolk is always inside
of the white.&nbsp; As for a soft-shelled egg, it is so rare an occurrence
that the fear of laying one could not set the whole race of hens in
a panic; so there really cannot be any intellectual or emotional agitation
in producing a thing that might be made by a machine.&nbsp; Can it be
simply &ldquo;fussiness&rdquo;; since the people who have the least
to do commonly make the most flutter about doing it?</p>
<p>Perhaps it is merely conversation.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Cut-cut-cut-cut-cut</i>-DAH<i>cut</i>!
. . . I have finished my strictly fresh egg, have you laid yours?&nbsp;
Make haste, then, for the cock has found a gap in the wire-fence and
wants us to wander in the strawberry-bed. . . . Cut-cut-cut-cut-cut-DAH<i>cut</i>
. . . Every moment is precious, for the Goose Girl will find us, when
she gathers the strawberries for her luncheon . . . Cut-cut-cut-cut!&nbsp;
On the way out we can find sweet places to steal nests . . . Cut-cut-cut!
. . . I am so glad I am not sitting this heavenly morning; it <i>is</i>
a dull life.</p>
<p>A Lancashire poultryman drifted into Barbury Green yesterday.&nbsp;
He is an old acquaintance of Mr. Heaven, and spent the night and part
of the next day at Thornycroft Farm.&nbsp; He possessed a deal of fowl
philosophy, and tells many a good hen story, which, like fish stories,
draw rather largely on the credulity of the audience.&nbsp; We were
sitting in the rickyard talking comfortably about laying and cackling
and kindred matters when he took his pipe from his mouth and told us
the following tale&mdash;not a bad one if you can translate the dialect:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aw were once towd as, if yo&rsquo; could only get th&rsquo;
hen&rsquo;s egg away afooar she hed sin it, th&rsquo; hen &lsquo;ud
think it hed med a mistek an&rsquo; sit deawn ageean an&rsquo; lay another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; it seemed to me it were a varra sensible way o&rsquo;
lukkin&rsquo; at it.&nbsp; Sooa aw set to wark to mek a nest as &rsquo;ud
tek a rise eawt o&rsquo; th&rsquo; hens.&nbsp; An&rsquo; aw dud it too.&nbsp;
Aw med a nest wi&rsquo; a fause bottom, th&rsquo; idea bein&rsquo; as
when a hen hed laid, th&rsquo; egg &rsquo;ud drop through into a box
underneyth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw felt varra preawd o&rsquo; that nest, too, aw con tell
yo&rsquo;, an&rsquo; aw remember aw felt quite excited when aw see an
awd black Minorca, th&rsquo; best layer as aw hed, gooa an&rsquo; settle
hersel deawn i&rsquo; th&rsquo; nest an&rsquo; get ready for wark.&nbsp;
Th&rsquo; hen seemed quite comfortable enough, aw were glad to see,
an&rsquo; geet through th&rsquo; operation beawt ony seemin&rsquo; trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, aw darsay yo&rsquo; know heaw a hen carries on as soon
as it&rsquo;s laid a egg.&nbsp; It starts &ldquo;chuckin&rsquo;&rdquo;
away like a showman&rsquo;s racket, an&rsquo; after tekkin&rsquo; a
good Ink at th&rsquo; egg to see whether it&rsquo;s a big &rsquo;un
or a little &rsquo;un, gooas eawt an&rsquo; tells all t&rsquo;other
hens abeawt it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neaw, this black Minorca, as aw sed, were a owdish bird, an&rsquo;
maybe knew mooar than aw thowt.&nbsp; Happen it hed laid on a nest wi&rsquo;
a fause bottom afooar, an&rsquo; were up to th&rsquo; trick, but whether
or not, aw never see a hen luk mooar disgusted i&rsquo; mi life when
it lukked i&rsquo; th&rsquo; nest an&rsquo; see as it hed hed all that
trouble fer nowt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It woked reawnd th&rsquo; nest as if it couldn&rsquo;t believe
its own eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it dudn&rsquo;t do as aw expected.&nbsp; Aw expected as
it &rsquo;ud sit deawn ageean an&rsquo; lay another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it just gi&rsquo;e one wonderin&rsquo; sooart o&rsquo;
chuck, an then, after a long stare reawnd th&rsquo; hen-coyt, it woked
eawt, as mad a hen as aw&rsquo;ve ever sin.&nbsp; Aw fun&rsquo; eawt
after, what th&rsquo; long stare meant.&nbsp; It were tekkin&rsquo;
farewell!&nbsp; For if yo&rsquo;ll believe me that hen never laid another
egg i&rsquo; ony o&rsquo; my nests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Varra like it laid away in a spot wheear it could hev summat
to luk at when it hed done wark for th&rsquo; day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sooa aw lost mi best layer through mi actin&rsquo;, an&rsquo;
aw&rsquo;ve never invented owt sen.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>One learns to be modest by living on a poultry farm, for there are
constant expositions of the most deplorable vanity among the cocks.&nbsp;
We have a couple of pea-fowl who certainly are an addition to the landscape,
as they step mincingly along the square of turf we dignify by the name
of lawn.&nbsp; The head of the house has a most languid and self-conscious
strut, and his microscopic mind is fixed entirely on his splendid trailing
tail.&nbsp; If I could only master his language sufficiently to tell
him how hideously ugly the back view of this gorgeous fan is, when he
spreads it for the edification of the observer in front of him, he would
of course retort that there is a &ldquo;congregation side&rdquo; to
everything, but I should at least force him into a defence of his tail
and a confession of its limitations.&nbsp; This would be new and unpleasant,
I fancy; and if it produced no perceptible effect upon his super-arrogant
demeanour, I might remind him that he is likely to be used, eventually,
for a feather duster, unless, indeed, the Heavens are superstitious
and prefer to throw his tail away, rather than bring ill luck and the
evil eye into the house.</p>
<p>The longer I study the cock, whether Black Spanish, White Leghorn,
Dorking, or the common barnyard fowl, the more intimately I am acquainted
with him, the less I am impressed with his character.&nbsp; He has more
pride of bearing, and less to be proud of, than any bird I know.&nbsp;
He is indolent, though he struts pompously over the grass as if the
day were all too short for his onerous duties.&nbsp; He calls the hens
about him when I throw corn from the basket, but many a time I have
seen him swallow hurriedly, and in private, some dainty titbit he has
found unexpectedly.&nbsp; He has no particular chivalry.&nbsp; He gives
no special encouragement to his hen when he becomes a prospective father,
and renders little assistance when the responsibilities become actualities.&nbsp;
His only personal message or contribution to the world is his raucous
cock-a-doodle-doo, which, being uttered most frequently at dawn, is
the most ill-timed and offensive of all musical notes.&nbsp; It is so
unnecessary too, as if the day didn&rsquo;t come soon enough without
his warning; but I suppose he is anxious to waken his hens and get them
at their daily task, and so he disturbs the entire community.&nbsp;
In short, I dislike him; his swagger, his autocratic strut, his greed,
his irritating self-consciousness, his endless parading of himself up
and down in a procession of one.</p>
<p>Of course his character is largely the result of polygamy.&nbsp;
His weaknesses are only what might be expected; and as for the hens,
I have considerable respect for the patience, sobriety, and dignity
with which they endure an institution particularly offensive to all
women.&nbsp; In their case they do not even have the sustaining thought
of its being an article of religion, so they are to be complimented
the more.</p>
<p>There is nothing on earth so feminine as a hen&mdash;not womanly,
simply feminine.&nbsp; Those men of insight who write the Woman&rsquo;s
Page in the Sunday newspapers study hens more than women, I sometimes
think; at any rate, their favourite types are all present on this poultry
farm.</p>
<p>Some families of White Leghorns spend most of their time in the rickyard,
where they look extremely pretty, their slender white shapes and red
combs and wattles well set off by the background of golden hayricks.&nbsp;
There is a great oak-tree in one corner, with a tall ladder leaning
against its trunk, and a capital roosting-place on a long branch running
at right angles with the ladder.&nbsp; I try to spend a quarter of an
hour there every night before supper, just for the pleasure of seeing
the feathered &ldquo;women-folks&rdquo; mount that ladder.</p>
<p>A dozen of them surround the foot, waiting restlessly for their turn.&nbsp;
One little white lady flutters up on the lowest round and perches there
until she reviews the past, faces the present, and forecasts the future;
during which time she is gathering courage for the next jump.&nbsp;
She cackles, takes up one foot and then the other, tilts back and forth,
holds up her skirts and drops them again, cocks her head nervously to
see whether they are all staring at her below, gives half a dozen preliminary
springs which mean nothing, declares she can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t
go up any faster, unties her bonnet strings and pushes back her hair,
pulls down her dress to cover her toes, and finally alights on the next
round, swaying to and fro until she gains her equilibrium, when she
proceeds to enact the same scene over again.</p>
<p>All this time the hens at the foot of the ladder are criticising
her methods and exclaiming at the length of time she requires in mounting;
while the cocks stroll about the yard keeping one eye on the ladder,
picking up a seed here and there, and giving a masculine sneer now and
then at the too-familiar scene.&nbsp; They approach the party at intervals,
but only to remark that it always makes a man laugh to see a woman go
up a ladder.&nbsp; The next hen, stirred to the depths by this speech,
flies up entirely too fast, loses her head, tumbles off the top round,
and has to make the ascent over again.&nbsp; Thus it goes on and on,
this <i>petite com&eacute;die humaine</i>, and I could enjoy it with
my whole heart if Mr. Heaven did not insist on sharing the spectacle
with me.&nbsp; He is so inexpressibly dull, so destitute of humour,
that I did not think it likely he would see in the performance anything
more than a flock of hens going up a ladder to roost.&nbsp; But he did;
for there is no man so blind that he cannot see the follies of women;
and, when he forgot himself so far as to utter a few genial, silly,
well-worn reflections upon femininity at large, I turned upon him and
revealed to him some of the characteristics of his own sex, gained from
an exhaustive study of the barnyard fowl of the masculine gender.&nbsp;
He went into the house discomfited, though chuckling a little at my
vehemence; but at least I have made it for ever impossible for him to
watch his hens without an occasional glance at the cocks.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>July 12th.</p>
<p>O the pathos of a poultry farm!&nbsp; Catherine of Aragon, the black
Spanish hen that stole her nest, brought out nine chicks this morning,
and the business-like and marble-hearted Phoebe has taken them away
and given them to another hen who has only seven.&nbsp; Two mothers
cannot be wasted on these small families&mdash;it would not be profitable;
and the older mother, having been tried and found faithful over seven,
has been given the other nine and accepted them.&nbsp; What of the bereft
one?&nbsp; She is miserable and stands about moping and forlorn, but
it is no use fighting against the inevitable; hens&rsquo; hearts must
obey the same laws that govern the rotation of crops.&nbsp; Catherine
of Aragon feels her lot a bitter one just now, but in time she will
succumb, and lay, which is more to the point.</p>
<p>We have had a very busy evening, beginning with the rats&rsquo; supper&mdash;delicate
sandwiches of bread-and-butter spread with Paris green.</p>
<p>We have a new brood of seventeen ducklings just hatched this afternoon.&nbsp;
When we came to the nest the yellow and brown bunches of down and fluff
were peeping out from under the hen&rsquo;s wings in the prettiest fashion
in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a noble hen!&rdquo; I said to Phoebe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t so nowble as she looks,&rdquo; Phoebe answered
grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was another &rsquo;en that brooded these eggs
for near on three weeks and then this big one come along with a fancy
she&rsquo;d like a family &rsquo;erself if she could steal one without
too much trouble; so she drove the rightful &rsquo;en off the nest,
finished up the last few days, and &rsquo;ere she is in possession of
the ducklings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take them away from her and give them
back to the first hen, who did most of the work?&rdquo; I asked, with
some spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like as not she wouldn&rsquo;t tyke them now,&rdquo; said
Phoebe, as she lifted the hen off the broken egg-shells and moved her
gently into a clean box, on a bed of fresh hay.&nbsp; We put food and
drink within reach of the family, and very proud and handsome that highway
robber of a hen looked, as she stretched her wings over the seventeen
easily-earned ducklings.</p>
<p>Going back to the old nesting-box, I found one egg forgotten among
the shells.&nbsp; It was still warm, and I took it up to run across
the field with it to Phoebe.&nbsp; It was heavy, and the carrying of
it was a queer sensation, inasmuch as it squirmed and &ldquo;yipped&rdquo;
vociferously in transit, threatening so unmistakably to hatch in my
hand that I was decidedly nervous.&nbsp; The intrepid little youngster
burst his shell as he touched Phoebe&rsquo;s apron, and has become the
strongest and handsomest of the brood.</p>
<p>All this tending of downy young things, this feeding and putting
to bed, this petting and nursing and rearing, is such pretty, comforting
woman&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; I am sure Phoebe will make a better wife to
the carrier for having been a poultry-maid, and though good enough for
most practical purposes when I came here, I am an infinitely better
woman now.&nbsp; I am afraid I was not particularly nice the last few
days at the Hydro.&nbsp; Such a lot of dull, prosy, inquisitive, bothering
old tabbies!&nbsp; Aunt Margaret furnishing imaginary symptoms enough
to keep a fond husband and two trained nurses distracted; a man I had
never encouraged in my life coming to stay in the neighbourhood and
turning up daily for rejection; another man taking rooms at the very
hotel with the avowed purpose of making my life a burden; and on the
heels of both, a widow of thirty-five in full chase!&nbsp; Small wonder
I thought it more dignified to retire than to compete, and so I did.</p>
<p>I need not, however, have cut the threads that bound me to Oxenbridge
with such particularly sharp scissors, nor given them such a vicious
snap; for, so far as I can observe, the little world of which I imagined
myself the sun continues to revolve, and, probably, about some other
centre.&nbsp; I can well imagine who has taken up that delightful but
somewhat exposed and responsible position&mdash;it would be just like
her!</p>
<p>I am perfectly happy where I am; it is not that; but it seems so
strange that they can be perfectly happy without me, after all that
they&mdash;after all that was said on the subject not many days ago.&nbsp;
Nothing turns out as one expects.&nbsp; There have been no hot pursuits,
no rewards offered, no bills posted, no printed placards issued describing
the beauty and charms of a young person who supposed herself the cynosure
of every eye.&nbsp; Heigh-ho!&nbsp; What does it matter, after all?&nbsp;
One can always be a Goose Girl!</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I wonder if the hen mother is quite, quite satisfied with her ducklings!&nbsp;
Do you suppose the fact of hatching and brooding them breaks down all
the sense of difference?&nbsp; Does she not sometimes reflect that if
her children were the ordinary sort, and not these changelings, she
would be enjoying certain pretty little attentions dear to a mother&rsquo;s
heart?&nbsp; The chicks would be pecking the food off her broad beak
with their tiny ones, and jumping on her back to slide down her glossy
feathers.&nbsp; They would be far nicer to cuddle, too, so small and
graceful and light; the changelings are a trifle solid and brawny.&nbsp;
And personally, just as a matter of taste, would she not prefer wee,
round, glancing heads, and pointed beaks, peeping from under her wings,
to these teaspoon-shaped things larger than her own?&nbsp; I wonder!</p>
<p>We are training fourteen large young chickens to sit on the perches
in their new house, instead of huddling together on the floor as has
been their habit, because we discover rat-holes under the wire flooring
occasionally, and fear that toes may be bitten.&nbsp; At nine o&rsquo;clock
Phoebe and I lift the chickens one by one, and, as it were, glue them
to their perches, squawking.&nbsp; Three nights have we gone patiently
through with this performance, but they have not learned the lesson.&nbsp;
The ducks and geese are, however, greatly improved by the application
of advanced educational methods, and the <i>r&eacute;gime</i> of perfect
order and system instituted by Me begins to show results.</p>
<p>There is no more violent splashing and pebbling, racing, chasing,
separating.&nbsp; The pole, indeed, still has to be produced, but at
the first majestic wave of my hand they scuttle toward the shore.&nbsp;
The geese turn to the right, cross the rickyard, and go to their pen;
the May ducks turn to the left for their coops, the June ducks follow
the hens to the top meadow, and even the idiot gosling has an inspiration
now and then and stumbles on his own habitation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Heaven has no reverence for the principles of Comenius, Pestalozzi,
or Herbert Spencer as applied to poultry, and when the ducks and geese
came out of the pond badly the other night and went waddling and tumbling
and hissing all over creation, did not approve of my sending them back
into the pond to start afresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider it a great waste of time, of good time, miss,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;and, after all, do you consider that educated poultry
will be any better eating, or that it will lay more than one egg a day,
miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have given the matter some attention, and I fear Mrs. Heaven is
right.&nbsp; A duck, a goose, or a hen in which I have developed a larger
brain, implanted a sense of duty, or instilled an idea of self-government,
is likely, on the whole, to be leaner, not fatter.&nbsp; There is nothing
like obeying the voice of conscience for taking the flesh off one&rsquo;s
bones; and, speaking of conscience, Phoebe, whose metaphysics are of
the farm farmy, says that hers &ldquo;felt like a hunlaid hegg for dyes&rdquo;
after she had jilted the postman.</p>
<p>As to the eggs, I am sure the birds will go on laying one a day for
&rsquo;tis their nature to.&nbsp; Whether the product of the intelligent,
conscious, logical fowl, will be as rich in quality as that of the uneducated
and barbaric bird, I cannot say; but it ought at least to be equal to
the Denmark egg eaten now by all Londoners; and if, perchance, left
uneaten, it is certain to be a very superior wife and mother.</p>
<p>While we are discussing the subject of educating poultry, I confess
that the case of Cannibal Ann gives me much anxiety.&nbsp; Twice in
her short career has she been under suspicion of eating her own eggs,
but Phoebe has never succeeded in catching her <i>in flagrante delicto</i>.&nbsp;
That eminent detective service was reserved for me, and I have been
haunted by the picture ever since.&nbsp; It is an awful sight to witness
a hen gulp her own newly-laid fresh egg, yolk, white, shell, and all;
to realise that you have fed, sheltered, chased, and occasionally run
in, a being possessed of no moral sense, a being likely to set a bad
example, inculcate vicious habits among her innocent sisters, and lower
the standard of an entire poultry-yard.&nbsp; <i>The Young Poultry Keeper&rsquo;s
Friend</i> gives us no advice on this topic, and we do not know whether
to treat Cannibal Ann as the victim of a disease, or as a confirmed
criminal; whether to administer remedies or cut her off in the flower
of her youth.</p>
<p>We have had a sad scene to-night.&nbsp; A chick has been ailing all
day, and when we shut up the brood we found him dead in a corner.</p>
<p>Phoebe put him on the ground while she busied herself about the coop.&nbsp;
The other chicks came out and walked about the dead one again and again,
eyeing him curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little chap!&rdquo; said Phoebe.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s
never &rsquo;ad a mother!&nbsp; &rsquo;E was an incubytor chicken, and
wherever I took &rsquo;im &rsquo;e was picked at.&nbsp; There was somethink
wrong with &rsquo;im; &rsquo;e never was a fyvorite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put the fluffy body into a hole in the turf, and strewed a handful
of grass over him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sad little epitaph!&rdquo; I thought.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He never was a fyvorite!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>July 13th.</p>
<p>I like to watch the Belgian hares eating their trifolium or pea-pods
or grass; graceful, gentle things they are, crowding about Mr. Heaven,
and standing prettily, not greedily, on their hind legs, to reach for
the clover, their delicate nostrils and whiskers all a-quiver with excitement.</p>
<p>As I look out of my window in the dusk I can see one of the mothers
galloping across the enclosure, the soft white lining of her tail acting
as a beacon-light to the eight infant hares following her, a quaint
procession of eight white spots in it glancing line.&nbsp; In the darkest
night those baby creatures could follow their mother through grass or
hedge or thicket, and she would need no warning note to show them where
to flee in case of danger.&nbsp; &ldquo;All you have to do is to follow
the white night-light that I keep in the lining of my tail,&rdquo; she
says, when she is giving her first maternal lectures; and it seems a
beneficent provision of Nature.&nbsp; To be sure, Mr. Heaven took his
gun and went out to shoot wild rabbits to-day, and I noted that he marked
them by those same self-betraying tails, as they scuttled toward their
holes or leaped toward the protecting cover of the hedge; so it does
not appear whether Nature is on the side of the farmer or the rabbit
. . .</p>
<p>There is as much comedy and as much tragedy in poultry life as anywhere,
and already I see rifts within lutes.&nbsp; We have in a cage a French
gentleman partridge married to a Hungarian lady of defective sight.&nbsp;
He paces back and forth in the pen restlessly, anything but content
with the domestic fireside.&nbsp; One can see plainly that he is devoted
to the Boulevards, and that if left to his own inclinations he would
never have chosen any spouse but a thorough Parisienne.</p>
<p>The Hungarian lady is blind of one eye, from some stray shot, I suppose.&nbsp;
She is melancholy at all times, and occasionally goes so far as to beat
her head against the wire netting.&nbsp; If liberated, Mr. Heaven says
that her blindness would only expose her to death at the hands of the
first sportsman, and it always seems to me as if she knows this, and
is ever trying to decide whether a loveless marriage is any better than
the tomb.</p>
<p>Then, again, the great, grey gander is, for some mysterious reason,
out of favour with the entire family.&nbsp; He is a noble and amiable
bird, by far the best all-round character in the flock, for dignity
of mien and large-minded common-sense.&nbsp; What is the treatment vouchsafed
to this blameless husband and father?&nbsp; One that puts anybody out
of sorts with virtue and its scant rewards.&nbsp; To begin with, the
others will not allow him to go into the pond.&nbsp; There is an organised
cabal against it, and he sits solitary on the bank, calm and resigned,
but, naturally, a trifle hurt.&nbsp; His favourite retreat is a tiny
sort of island on the edge of the pool under the alders, where with
his bent head, and red-rimmed philosophic eyes he regards his own breast
and dreams of happier days.&nbsp; When the others walk into the country
twenty-three of them keep together, and Burd Alane (as I have named
him from the old ballad) walks by himself.&nbsp; The lack of harmony
is so evident here, and the slight so intentional and direct, that it
almost moves me to tears.&nbsp; The others walk soberly, always in couples,
but even Burd Alane&rsquo;s rightful spouse is on the side of the majority,
and avoids her consort.</p>
<p>What is the nature of his offence?&nbsp; There can be no connubial
jealousies, I judge, as geese are strictly monogamous, and having chosen
a partner of their joys and sorrows they cleave to each other until
death or some other inexorable circumstance does them part.&nbsp; If
they are ever mistaken in their choice, and think they might have done
better, the world is none the wiser.&nbsp; Burd Alane looks in good
condition, but Phoebe thinks he is not quite himself, and that some
day when he is in greater strength he will turn on his foes and rend
them, regaining thus his lost prestige, for formerly he was king of
the flock.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Phoebe has not a vestige of sentiment.&nbsp; She just asked me if
I would have a duckling or a gosling for dinner; that there were two
quite ready&mdash;the brown and yellow duckling, that is the last to
leave the water at night, and the white gosling that never knows his
own &rsquo;ouse.&nbsp; Which would I &rsquo;ave, and would I &rsquo;ave
it with sage and onion?</p>
<p>Now, had I found a duckling on the table at dinner I should have
eaten it without thinking at all, or with the thought that it had come
from Barbury Green.&nbsp; But eat a duckling that I have stoned out
of the pond, pursued up the bank, chased behind the wire netting, caught,
screaming, in a corner, and carried struggling to his bed?&nbsp; Feed
upon an idiot gosling that I have found in nine different coops on nine
successive nights&mdash;in with the newly-hatched chicks, the half-grown
pullets, the setting hen, the &ldquo;invaleed goose,&rdquo; the drake
with the gapes, the old ducks in the pen?&mdash;Eat a gosling that I
have caught and put in with his brothers and sisters (whom he never
recognises) so frequently and regularly that I am familiar with every
joint in his body?</p>
<p>In the first place, with my own small bump of locality and lack of
geography, I would never willingly consume a creature who might, by
some strange process of assimilation, make me worse in this respect;
in the second place, I should have to be ravenous indeed to sit down
deliberately and make a meal of an intimate friend, no matter if I had
not a high opinion of his intelligence.&nbsp; I should as soon think
of eating the Square Baby, stuffed with sage and onion and garnished
with green apple-sauce, as the yellow duckling or the idiot gosling.</p>
<p>Mrs. Heaven has just called me into her sitting-room, ostensibly
to ask me to order breakfast, but really for the pleasure of conversation.&nbsp;
Why she should inquire whether I would relish some gammon of bacon with
eggs, when she knows that there has not been, is not now, and never
will be, anything but gammon of bacon with eggs, is more than I can
explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to see my flowers, miss?&rdquo; she asks, folding
her plump hands over her white apron.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are looking
beautiful this morning.&nbsp; I am so fond of potted plants, of plants
in pots.&nbsp; Look at these geraniums!&nbsp; Now, I consider that pink
one a perfect bloom; yes, a perfect bloom.&nbsp; This is a fine red
one, is it not, miss?&nbsp; Especially fine, don&rsquo;t you think?&nbsp;
The trouble with the red variety is that they&rsquo;re apt to get &ldquo;bobby&rdquo;
and have to be washed regularly; quite bobby they do get indeed, I assure
you.&nbsp; That white one has just gone out of blossom, and it was really
wonderful.&nbsp; You could &rsquo;ardly have told it from a paper flower,
miss, not from a white paper flower.&nbsp; My plants are my children
nowadays, since Albert Edward is my only care.&nbsp; I have been the
mother of eleven children, miss, all of them living, so far as I know;
I know nothing to the contrary.&nbsp; I &rsquo;ope you are not wearying
of this solitary place, miss?&nbsp; It will grow upon you, I am sure,
as it did upon Mrs. Pollock, with all her peculiar fancies, and as it
&rsquo;as grown upon us.&mdash;We formerly had a butcher&rsquo;s shop
in Buffington, and it was naturally a great responsibility.&nbsp; Mr.
Heaven&rsquo;s nerves are not strong, and at last he wanted a life of
more quietude, more quietude was what he craved.&nbsp; The life of a
retail butcher is a most exciting and wearying one.&nbsp; Nobody satisfied
with their meat; as if it mattered in a world of change!&nbsp; Everybody
complaining of too much bone or too little fat; nobody wishing tough
chops or cutlets, but always seeking after fine joints, when it&rsquo;s
against reason and nature that all joints should be juicy and all cutlets
tender; always complaining if livers are not sent with every fowl, always
asking you to remember the trimmin&rsquo;s, always wanting their beef
well &rsquo;ung, and then if you &rsquo;ang it a minute too long, it&rsquo;s
left on your &rsquo;ands!&nbsp; I often used to say to Mr. Heaven, yes
many&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve said it, that if people would think
more of the great &rsquo;ereafter and less about their own little stomachs,
it would be a deal better for them, yes, a deal better, and make it
much more comfortable for the butchers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Burd Alane has had a good quarter of an hour to-day.</p>
<p>His spouse took a brief promenade with him.&nbsp; To be sure, it
was during an absence of the flock on the other side of the hedge so
that the moral effect of her spasm of wifely loyalty was quite lost
upon them.&nbsp; I strongly suspect that she would not have granted
anything but a secret interview.&nbsp; What a petty, weak, ignoble character!&nbsp;
I really don&rsquo;t like to think so badly of any fellow-creature as
I am forced to think of that politic, time-serving, pusillanimous goose.&nbsp;
I believe she laid the egg that produced the idiot gosling!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>Here follows the true story of Sir Muscovy Drake, the Lady Blanche,
and Miss Malardina Crippletoes.</p>
<p>Phoebe&rsquo;s flock consisted at first mostly of Brown Mallards,
but a friend gave her a sitting of eggs warranted to produce a most
beautiful variety of white ducks.&nbsp; They were hatched in due time,
but proved hard to raise, till at length there was only one survivor,
of such uncommon grace and beauty that we called her the Lady Blanche.&nbsp;
Presently a neighbour sold Phoebe his favourite Muscovy drake, and these
two splendid creatures by &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo; disdained
to notice the rest of the flock, but forming a close friendship, wandered
in the pleasant paths of duckdom together, swimming and eating quite
apart from the others.</p>
<p>In the brown flock there was one unfortunate, misshapen from the
egg, quite lame, and with no smoothness of plumage; but on that very
account, apparently, or because she was too weak to resist them, the
others treated her cruelly, biting her and pushing her away from the
food.</p>
<p>One day it happened that the two ducks&mdash;Sir Muscovy and Lady
Blanche&mdash;had come up from the water before the others, and having
taken their repast were sitting together under the shade of a flowering
currant-bush, when they chanced to see poor Miss Crippletoes very badly
used and crowded away from the dish.&nbsp; Sir Muscovy rose to his feet;
a few rapid words seemed to pass between him and his mate, and then
he fell upon the other drake and the heartless minions who had persecuted
the helpless one, drove them far away out of sight, and, returning,
went to the corner where the victim was cowering, her face to the wall.&nbsp;
He seemed to whisper to her, or in some way to convey to her a sense
of protection; for after a few moments she tremblingly went with him
to the dish, and hurriedly ate her dinner while he stood by, repulsing
the advances of the few brown ducks who remained near and seemed inclined
to attack her.</p>
<p>When she had eaten enough Lady Blanche joined them, and they went
down the hill together to their favourite swimming-place.&nbsp; After
that Miss Crippletoes always followed a little behind her protectors,
and thus shielded and fed she grew stronger and well-feathered, though
she was always smaller than she should have been and had a lowly manner,
keeping a few steps in the rear of her superiors and sitting at some
distance from their noon resting-place.</p>
<p>Phoebe noticed after a while that Lady Blanche was seldom to be seen,
and Sir Muscovy and Miss Crippletoes often came to their meals without
her.&nbsp; The would-be mother refused to inhabit the house Phoebe had
given her, and for a long time the place she had chosen for her sitting
could not be found.&nbsp; At length the Square Baby discovered her in
a most ideal spot.&nbsp; A large boulder had dropped years ago into
the brook that fills our duck-pond; dropped and split in halves with
the two smooth walls leaning away from each other.&nbsp; A grassy bank
towered behind, and on either side of the opening, tall bushes made
a miniature forest where the romantic mother could brood her treasures
while her two guardians enjoyed the water close by her retreat.</p>
<p>All this happened before my coming to Thornycroft Farm, but it was
I who named the hero and heroines of the romance when Phoebe had told
me all the particulars.&nbsp; Yesterday morning I was sitting by my
open window.&nbsp; It was warm, sunny, and still, but in the country
sounds travel far, and I could hear fowl conversation in various parts
of the poultry-yard as well as in all the outlying bits of territory
occupied by our feathered friends.&nbsp; Hens have only three words
and a scream in their language, but ducks, having more thoughts to express,
converse quite fluently, so fluently, in fact, that it reminds me of
dinner at the Hydropathic Hotel.&nbsp; I fancy I have learned to distinguish
seven separate sounds, each varied by degrees of intensity, and with
upward or downward inflections like the Chinese tongue.</p>
<p>In the distance, then, I heard the faint voice of a duck calling
as if breathless and excited.&nbsp; While I wondered what was happening,
I saw Miss Crippletoes struggling up the steep bank above the duck-pond.&nbsp;
It was the quickest way from the water to the house, but difficult for
the little lame webbed feet.&nbsp; When she reached the level grass
sward she sank down a moment, exhausted; but when she could speak again
she cried out, a sharp staccato call, and ran forward.</p>
<p>Instantly she was answered from a distant knoll, where for some reason
Sir Muscovy loved to retire for meditation.&nbsp; The cries grew lower
and softer as the birds approached each other, and they met at the corner
just under my window.&nbsp; Instantly they put their two bills together
and the loud cries changed to confiding murmurs.&nbsp; Evidently some
hurried questions and answers passed between them, and then Sir Muscovy
waddled rapidly by the quickest path, Miss Crippletoes following him
at a slower pace, and both passed out of sight, using their wings to
help their feet down the steep declivity.&nbsp; The next morning, when
I wakened early, my first thought was to look out, and there on the
sunny greensward where they were accustomed to be fed, Sir Muscovy,
Lady Blanche, and their humble maid, Malardina Crippletoes, were scattering
their own breakfast before the bills of twelve beautiful golden balls
of ducklings.&nbsp; The little creatures could never have climbed the
bank, but must have started from their nest at dawn, coming round by
the brook to the level at the foot of the garden, and so by slow degrees
up to the house.</p>
<p>Judging from what I heard and knew of their habits, I am sure the
excitement of the previous morning was occasioned by the hatching of
the eggs, and that Lady Blanche had hastily sent her friend to call
Sir Muscovy, the family remaining together until they could bring the
babies with them and display their beauty to Phoebe and me.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>July 14th.</p>
<p>We are not wholly without the pleasures of the town in Barbury Green.&nbsp;
Once or twice in a summer, late on a Saturday afternoon, a procession
of red and yellow vans drives into a field near the centre of the village.&nbsp;
By the time the vans are unpacked all the children in the community
are surrounding the gate of entrance.&nbsp; There is rifle-shooting,
there is fortune-telling, there are games of pitch and toss, and swings,
and French bagatelle; and, to crown all, a wonderful orchestrion that
goes by steam.&nbsp; The water is boiled for the public&rsquo;s tea,
and at the same time thrilling strains of melody are flung into the
air.&nbsp; There is at present only one tune in the orchestrion&rsquo;s
repertory, but it is a very good tune; though after hearing it three
hundred and seven times in a single afternoon, it pursues one, sleeping
and waking, for the next week.&nbsp; Phoebe and I took the Square Baby
and went in to this diversified entertainment.&nbsp; There was a small
crowd of children at the entrance, but as none of them seemed to be
provided with pennies, and I felt in a fairy godmother mood, I offered
them the freedom of the place at my expense.</p>
<p>I never purchased more radiant good-will for less money, but the
combined effect of the well-boiled tea and the boiling orchestrion produced
many village nightmares, so the mothers told me at chapel next morning.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I have many friends in Barbury Green, and often have a pleasant chat
with the draper, and the watchmaker, and the chemist.</p>
<p>The last house on the principal street is rather an ugly one, with
especially nice window curtains.&nbsp; As I was taking my daily walk
to the post-office (an entirely unfruitful expedition thus far, as nobody
has taken the pains to write to me) I saw a nursemaid coming out of
the gate, wheeling a baby in a perambulator.&nbsp; She was going placidly
away from the Green when, far in the distance, she espied a man walking
rapidly toward us, a heavy Gladstone bag in one hand.&nbsp; She gazed
fixedly for a moment, her eyes brightening and her cheeks flushing with
pleasure,&mdash;whoever it was, it was an unexpected arrival;&mdash;then
she retraced her steps and, running up the garden-path, opened the front
door and held an excited colloquy with somebody; a slender somebody
in a nice print gown and neatly-dressed hair, who came to the gate and
peeped beyond the hedge several times, drawing back between peeps with
smiles and heightened colour.&nbsp; She did not run down the road, even
when she had satisfied herself of the identity of the traveller; perhaps
that would not have been good form in an English village, for there
were houses on the opposite side of the way.&nbsp; She waited until
he opened the gate, the nursemaid took the bag and looked discreetly
into the hedge, then the mistress slipped her hand through the traveller&rsquo;s
arm and walked up the path as if she had nothing else in the world to
wish for.&nbsp; The nurse had a part in the joy, for she lifted the
baby out of the perambulator and showed proudly how much he had grown.</p>
<p>It was a dear little scene, and I, a passer-by, had shared in it
and felt better for it.&nbsp; I think their content was no less because
part of it had enriched my life, for happiness, like mercy, is twice
blessed; it blesses those who are most intimately associated in it,
and it blesses all those who see it, hear it, feel it, touch it, or
breathe the same atmosphere.&nbsp; A laughing, crowing baby in a house,
one cheerful woman singing about her work, a boy whistling at the plough,
a romance just suspected, with its miracle of two hearts melting into
one&mdash;the wind&rsquo;s always in the west when you have any of these
wonder-workers in your neighbourhood.</p>
<p>I have talks too, sometimes, with the old parson, who lives in a
quaint house with &ldquo;<i>Parva Domus Magna Quies</i>&rdquo; cut into
the stone over the doorway.&nbsp; He is not a preaching parson, but
a retired one, almost the nicest kind, I often think.</p>
<p>He has been married thirty years, he tells me; thirty years, spent
in the one little house with the bricks painted red and grey alternately,
and the scarlet holly-hocks growing under the windows.&nbsp; I am sure
they have been sweet, true, kind years, and that his heart must be a
quiet, peaceful place just like his house and garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only eleven years old when I fell in love with my wife,&rdquo;
he told me as we sat on the seat under the lime-tree; he puffing cosily
at his pipe, I plaiting grasses for a hatband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just before Sunday-school.&nbsp; Her mother had dressed
her all in white muslin like a fairy, but she had stepped on the edge
of a puddle, and some of the muddy water had bespattered her frock.&nbsp;
A circle of children had surrounded her, and some of the motherly little
girls were on their knees rubbing at the spots anxiously, while one
of them wiped away the tears that were running down her pretty cheeks.&nbsp;
I looked!&nbsp; It was fatal!&nbsp; I did not look again, but I was
smitten to the very heart!&nbsp; I did not speak to her for six years,
but when I did, it was all right with both of us, thank God! and I&rsquo;ve
been in love with her ever since, when she behaves herself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is the way they speak of love in Barbury Green, and oh! how
much sweeter and more wholesome it is than the language of the town!&nbsp;
Who would not be a Goose Girl, &ldquo;to win the secret of the weed&rsquo;s
plain heart&rdquo;?&nbsp; It seems to me that in society we are always
gazing at magic-lantern shows, but here we rest our tired eyes with
looking at the stars.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>July 16th.</p>
<p>Phoebe and I have been to a Hen Conference at Buffington.&nbsp; It
was for the purpose of raising the standard of the British Hen, and
our local Countess, who is much interested in poultry, was in the chair.</p>
<p>It was a very learned body, but Phoebe had coached me so well that
at the noon recess I could talk confidently with the members, discussing
the various advantages of True and Crossed Minorcas, Feverels, Andalusians,
Cochin Chinas, Shanghais, and the White Leghorn.&nbsp; (Phoebe, when
she pronounces this word, leaves out the &ldquo;h&rdquo; and bears down
heavily on the last syllable, so that it rhymes with begone!)</p>
<p>As I was sitting under the trees waiting for Phoebe to finish some
shopping in the village, a travelling poultry-dealer came along and
offered to sell me a silver Wyandotte pullet and cockerel.&nbsp; This
was a new breed to me and I asked the price, which proved to be more
than I should pay for a hat in Bond Street.&nbsp; I hesitated, thinking
meantime what a delightful parting gift they would be for Phoebe; I
mean if we ever should part, which seems more and more unlikely, as
I shall never leave Thornycroft until somebody comes properly to fetch
me; indeed, unless the &ldquo;fetching&rdquo; is done somewhat speedily
I may decline to go under any circumstances.&nbsp; My indecision as
to the purchase was finally banished when the poultryman asserted that
the fowls had clear open centres all over, black lacing entirely round
the white centres, were free from white edging, and each had a cherry-red
eye.&nbsp; This catalogue of charms inflamed my imagination, though
it gave me no mental picture of a silver Wyandotte fowl, and I paid
the money while the dealer crammed the chicks, squawking into my five-o&rsquo;clock
tea-basket.</p>
<p>The afternoon session of the conference was most exciting, for we
reached the subject of imported eggs, an industry that is assuming terrifying
proportions.&nbsp; The London hotel egg comes from Denmark, it seems,&mdash;I
should think by sailing vessel, not steamer, but I may be wrong.&nbsp;
After we had settled that the British Hen should be protected and encouraged,
and agreed solemnly to abstain from Danish eggs in any form, and made
a resolution stating that our loyalty to Queen Alexandra would remain
undiminished, we argued the subject of hen diet.&nbsp; There was a great
difference of opinion here and the discussion was heated; the honorary
treasurer standing for pulped mangold and flint grit, the chair insisting
on barley meal and randans, while one eloquent young woman declared,
to loud cries of &ldquo;&rsquo;Ear, &rsquo;ear!&rdquo; that rice pudding
and bone chips produce more eggs to the square hen than any other sort
of food.&nbsp; Impassioned orators arose here and there in the audience
demanding recognition for beef scraps, charcoal, round corn or buckwheat.&nbsp;
Foods were regarded from various standpoints: as general invigorators,
growth assisters, and egg producers.&nbsp; A very handsome young farmer
carried off final honours, and proved to the satisfaction of all the
feminine poultry-raisers that green young hog bones fresh cut in the
Banner Bone Breaker (of which he was the agent) possessed a nutritive
value not to be expressed in human language.</p>
<p>Phoebe was distinctly nervous when I rose to say a few words on poultry
breeding, announcing as my topic &ldquo;Mothers, Stepmothers, Foster-Mothers,
and Incubators.&rdquo;&nbsp; Protected by the consciousness that no
one in the assemblage could possibly know me, I made a distinct success
in my maiden speech; indeed, I somewhat overshot the mark, for the Countess
in the chair sent me a note asking me to dine with her that evening.&nbsp;
I suppressed the note and took Phoebe away before the proceedings were
finished, vanishing from the scene of my triumphs like a veiled prophet.</p>
<p>Just as we were passing out the door we paused to hear the report
of a special committee whose chairman read the following resolutions:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Whereas</i>,&mdash;It has pleased the Almighty to remove from
our midst our greatest Rose Comb Buff Orpington fancier and esteemed
friend, Albert Edward Sheridain; therefore be it</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>,&mdash;That the next edition of our catalogue contain
an illustrated memorial page in his honour and</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>,&mdash;That the Rose Comb Buff Orpington Club extend
to the bereaved family their heartfelt sympathy.</p>
<p>The handsome young farmer followed us out to our trap, invited us
to attend the next meeting of the R. C. B. O. Club, of which he was
the secretary, and asked if I were intending to &ldquo;show.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I introduced Phoebe as the senior partner, and she concealed the fact
that we possessed but one Buff Orpington, and he was a sad &ldquo;invaleed&rdquo;
not suitable for exhibition.&nbsp; The farmer&rsquo;s expression as
he looked at me was almost lover-like, and when he pressed a bit of
paper into my hand I was sure it must be an offer of marriage.&nbsp;
It was in fact only a circular describing the Banner Bone Breaker.&nbsp;
It closed with an appeal to Buff Orpington breeders to raise and ever
raise the standard, bidding them remember, in the midst of a low-minded
and sordid civilisation, that the rose comb should be small and neat,
firmly set on, with good working, a nice spike at the back lying well
down to head, and never, under any circumstances, never sticking up.&nbsp;
This adjuration somewhat alarmed us as Phoebe and I had been giving
our Buff Orpington cockerel the most drastic remedies for his languid
and prostrate comb.</p>
<p>Coming home we alighted from the trap to gather hogweed for the rabbits.&nbsp;
I sat by the wayside lazily and let Phoebe gather the appetising weed,
which grows along the thorniest hedges in close proximity to nettles
and thistles.</p>
<p>Workmen were trudging along with their luncheon-baskets of woven
bulrushes slung over their shoulders.&nbsp; Fields of ripening grain
lay on either hand, the sun shining on their every shade of green and
yellow, bronze and orange, while the breeze stirred the bearded barley
into a rippling golden sea.</p>
<p>Phoebe asked me if the people I had left behind at the Hydropathic
were my relatives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of them are of remote consanguinity,&rdquo; I responded
evasively, and the next question was hushed upon her awe-stricken tongue,
as I intended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are obeying my wish to be let alone, there&rsquo;s no
doubt of that,&rdquo; I was thinking.&nbsp; &ldquo;For my part, I like
a little more spirit, and a little less &lsquo;letter&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the word &ldquo;letter&rdquo; flitted through my thoughts, I pulled
one from my pocket and glanced through it carelessly.&nbsp; It arrived,
somewhat tardily, only last night, or I should not have had it with
me.&nbsp; I wore the same dress to the post-office yesterday that I
wore to the Hen Conference to-day, and so it chanced to be still in
the pocket.&nbsp; If it had been anything I valued, of course I should
have lost or destroyed it by mistake; it is only silly, worthless little
things like this that keep turning up and turning up after one has forgotten
their existence.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You are a mystery!&rdquo; [it ran.]&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can apprehend, but not comprehend you.&nbsp; I know you in part.&nbsp;
I understand various bits of your nature; but my knowledge is always
fragmentary and disconnected, and when I attempt to make a whole of
the mosaics I merely get a kaleidoscopic effect.&nbsp; Do you know those
geographical dissected puzzles that they give to children?&nbsp; You
remind me of one of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have spent many charming (and dangerous) hours trying to
&lsquo;put you together&rsquo;; but I find, when I examine my picture
closely, that after all I&rsquo;ve made a purple mountain grow out of
a green tree; that my river is running up a steep hillside; and that
the pretty milkmaid, who should be wandering in the forest, is standing
on her head with her pail in the air</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you understand yourself clearly?&nbsp; Or is it just possible
that when you dive to the depths of your own consciousness, you sometimes
find the pretty milkmaid standing on her head?&nbsp; I wonder!&rdquo;
. . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, well, it is no wonder that he wonders!&nbsp;&nbsp; So do I, for
that matter!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>July 17th.</p>
<p>Thornycroft Farm seems to be the musical centre of the universe.</p>
<p>When I wake very early in the morning I lie in a drowsy sort of dream,
trying to disentangle, one from the other, the various bird notes, trills,
coos, croons, chirps, chirrups, and warbles.&nbsp; Suddenly there falls
on the air a delicious, liquid, finished song; so pure, so mellow, so
joyous, that I go to the window and look out at the morning world, half
awakened, like myself.</p>
<p>There is I know not what charm in a window that does not push up,
but opens its lattices out into the greenness.&nbsp; And mine is like
a little jewelled door, for the sun is shining from behind the chimneys
and lighting the tiny diamond panes with amber flashes.</p>
<p>A faint delicate haze lies over the meadow, and rising out of it,
and soaring toward the blue is the lark, flinging out that matchless
matin song, so rich, so thrilling, so lavish!&nbsp; As the blithe melody
fades away, I hear the plaintive ballad-fragments of the robin on a
curtsying branch near my window; and there is always the liquid pipe
of the thrush, who must quaff a fairy goblet of dew between his songs,
I should think, so fresh and eternally young is his note.</p>
<p>There is another beautiful song that I follow whenever I hear it,
straining my eyes to the treetops, yet never finding a bird that I can
identify as the singer.&nbsp; Can it be the&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ousel-cock so black of hue,<br />
With orange-tawny bill&rdquo;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is called the poet-laureate of the primrose time, but I don&rsquo;t
know whether he sings in midsummer, and I have not seen him hereabouts.&nbsp;
I must write and ask my dear Man of the North.&nbsp; The Man of the
North, I sometimes think, had a Fairy Grandmother who was a robin; and
perhaps she made a nest of fresh moss and put him in the green wood
when he was a wee bairnie, so that he waxed wise in bird-lore without
knowing it.&nbsp; At all events, describe to him the cock of a head,
the glance of an eye, the tip-up of a tail, or the sheen of a feather,
and he will name you the bird.&nbsp; Near-sighted he is, too, the Man
of the North, but that is only for people.</p>
<p>The Square Baby and I have a new game.</p>
<p>I bought a doll&rsquo;s table and china tea-set in Buffington.&nbsp;
We put it under an apple-tree in the side garden, where the scarlet
lightning grows so tall and the Madonna lilies stand so white against
the flaming background.&nbsp; We built a little fence around it, and
every afternoon at tea-time we sprinkle seeds and crumbs in the dishes,
water in the tiny cups, drop a cherry in each of the fruit-plates, and
have a <i>th&eacute; chantant</i> for the birdies.&nbsp; We sometimes
invite an &ldquo;invaleed&rdquo; duckling, or one of the baby rabbits,
or the peacock, in which case the cards read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Thornycroft Farm.<br />
The pleasure of your company is requested<br />
at a<br />
Th&eacute; Chantant<br />
Under the Apple Tree.<br />
Music at five.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a charming game, as I say, but I&rsquo;d far rather play it
with the Man of the North; he is so much younger than the Square Baby,
and so much more responsive, too.</p>
<p>Thornycroft Farm is a sweet place, too, of odours as well as sounds.&nbsp;
The scent of the hay is for ever in the nostrils, the hedges are thick
with wild honeysuckle, so deliciously fragrant, the last of the June
roses are lingering to do their share, and blackberry blossoms and ripening
fruit as well.</p>
<p>I have never known a place in which it is so easy to be good.&nbsp;
I have not said a word, nor scarcely harboured a thought, that was not
lovely and virtuous since I entered these gates, and yet there are those
who think me fantastic, difficult, hard to please, unreasonable!</p>
<p>I believe the saints must have lived in the country mostly (I am
certain they never tried Hydropathic hotels), and why anybody with a
black heart and natural love of wickedness should not simply buy a poultry
farm and become an angel, I cannot understand.</p>
<p>Living with animals is really a very improving and wholesome kind
of life, to the person who will allow himself to be influenced by their
sensible and high-minded ideals.&nbsp; When you come to think about
it, man is really the only animal that ever makes a fool of himself;
the others are highly civilised, and never make mistakes.&nbsp; I am
going to mention this when I write to somebody, sometime; I mean if
I ever do.&nbsp; To be sure, our human life is much more complicated
than theirs, and I believe when the other animals notice our errors
of judgment they make allowances.&nbsp; The bee is as busy as a bee,
and the beaver works like a beaver, but there their responsibility ends.&nbsp;
The bee doesn&rsquo;t have to go about seeing that other bees are not
crowded into unsanitary tenements or victimised by the sweating system.&nbsp;
When the beaver&rsquo;s day of toil is over he doesn&rsquo;t have to
discuss the sphere, the rights, or the voting privileges of beaveresses;
all he has to do is to work like a beaver, and that is comparatively
simple.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>I have been studying <i>The Young Poultry Keeper&rsquo;s Friend</i>
of late.&nbsp; If there is anything I dislike and deplore, it is the
possession of knowledge which I cannot put to practical use.&nbsp; Having
discovered an interesting disease called Scaly Leg in the July number,
I took the magazine out into the poultry-yard and identified the malady
on three hens and a cock.&nbsp; Phoebe joined me in the diagnosis and
we treated the victims with a carbolic lotion and scrubbed them with
vaseline.</p>
<p>As Phoebe and I grow wise in medical lore the case of Cannibal Ann
assumes a different aspect.&nbsp; As the bibulous man quaffs more and
more flagons of beer and wine when his daily food is ham, salt fish,
and cabbage, so does the hen avenge her wrongs of diet and woes of environment.&nbsp;
Cannibal Ann, herself, has, so far as we know, been raised in a Christian
manner and enjoyed all the advantages of modern methods; but her maternal
parent may have lived in some heathen poultry-yard which was asphalted
or bricked or flagged, so that she was debarred from scratching in Mother
Earth and was forced to eat her own shells in self-defence.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The Square Baby is not particularly attracted by the poultry as a
whole, save when it is boiled with bacon or roasted with bread-sauce;
but he is much interested in the &ldquo;invaleeds.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whenever
Phoebe and I start for the hospital with the tobacco-pills, the tin
of paraffin, and the bottle of oil, he is very much in evidence.&nbsp;
Perhaps he has a natural leaning toward the medical profession; at any
rate, when pain and anguish wring the brow, he is in close attendance
upon the ministering angels.</p>
<p>Now it is necessary for the physician to have practice as well as
theory, so the Square Baby, being left to himself this afternoon, proceeded
to perfect himself in some of the healing arts used by country practitioners.</p>
<p>When discovered, he was seated in front of the wire-covered &ldquo;run&rdquo;
attached to a coop occupied by the youngest goslings.&nbsp; A couple
of bottles and a box stood by his side, and I should think he had administered
a cup of sweet oil, a pint of paraffin, and a quarter of a pound of
tobacco during his clinic.&nbsp; He had used the remedies impartially,
sometimes giving the paraffin internally and rubbing the patient&rsquo;s
head with tobacco or oil, sometimes the reverse.</p>
<p>Several goslings leaned languidly against the netting, or supported
themselves by the edge of the water-dish, while others staggered and
reeled about with eyes half closed.</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Heaven who caught her son red-handed, so to speak.&nbsp;
She was dressed in her best, and just driving off to Woodmucket to spend
a day or two with her married daughter, and soothe her nerves with the
uproar incident to a town of six hundred inhabitants.&nbsp; She delayed
her journey a half-hour&mdash;long enough, in fact, to change her black
silk waist for a loose sacque which would give her arms full and comfortable
play.&nbsp; The joy and astonishment that greeted the Square Baby on
his advent, five years ago, was forgotten for the first time in his
brief life, and he was treated precisely as any ordinary wrongdoer would
have been treated under the same circumstances, summarily and smartly;
the &ldquo;wepping,&rdquo; as Phoebe would say, being Mrs. Heaven&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>All but one of the goslings lived, like thousands of others who recover
in spite of the doctors, but the Square Baby&rsquo;s interest in the
healing art is now perceptibly lessened.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>July 18th.</p>
<p>The day was Friday; Phoebe&rsquo;s day to go to Buffington with eggs
and chickens and rabbits; her day to solicit orders for ducklings and
goslings.&nbsp; The village cart was ready in the stable; Mr. and Mrs.
Heaven were in Woodmucket; I was eating my breakfast (which I remember
was an egg and a rasher) when Phoebe came in, a figure of woe.</p>
<p>The Square Baby was ill, very ill, and would not permit her to leave
him and go to market.&nbsp; Would I look at him?&nbsp; For he must have
dowsed &rsquo;imself as well as the goslings yesterday; anyways he was
strong of paraffin and tobacco, though he &rsquo;ad &rsquo;ad a good
barth.</p>
<p>I prescribed for Albert Edward, who was as uncomfortable and feverish
as any little sinner in the county of Sussex, and I then promptly proposed
going to Buffington in Phoebe&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>She did not think it at all proper, and said that, notwithstanding
my cotton gown and sailor hat, I looked quite, quite the lydy, and it
would never do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot get any new orders,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I can
certainly leave the rabbits and eggs at the customary places.&nbsp;
I know Argent&rsquo;s Dining Parlours, and Songhurst&rsquo;s Tea Rooms,
and the Six Bells Inn, as well as you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, donning a pair of Phoebe&rsquo;s large white cotton gloves with
open-work wrists (than which I always fancy there is no one article
that so disguises the perfect lydy), I set out upon my travels, upborne
by a lively sense of amusement that was at least equal to my feeling
that I was doing Phoebe Heaven a good turn.</p>
<p>Prices in dressed poultry were fluctuating, but I had a copy of <i>The
Trade Review</i>, issued that very day, and was able to get some idea
of values and the state of the market as I jogged along.&nbsp; The general
movement, I learned, was moderate and of a &ldquo;selective&rdquo; character.&nbsp;
Choice large capons and ducks were in steady demand, but I blushed for
my profession when I read that roasting chickens were running coarse,
staggy, and of irregular value.&nbsp; Old hens were held firmly at sixpence,
and it is my experience that they always have to be, at whatever price.&nbsp;
Geese were plenty, dull, and weak.&nbsp; Old cocks,&mdash;why don&rsquo;t
they say roosters?&mdash;declined to threepence ha&rsquo;penny on Thursday
in sympathy with fowls,&mdash;and who shall say that chivalry is dead?&nbsp;
Turkeys were a trifle steadier, and there was a speculative movement
in limed eggs.&nbsp; All this was illuminating, and I only wished I
were quite certain whether the sympathetic old roosters were threepence
ha&rsquo;penny apiece, or a pound.</p>
<p>Everything happened as it should, on this first business journey
of my life, which is equivalent to saying that nothing happened at all.&nbsp;
Songhurst&rsquo;s Tea Rooms took five dozen eggs and told me to bring
six dozen the next week.&nbsp; Argent&rsquo;s Dining Parlours purchased
three pairs of chickens and four rabbits.&nbsp; The Six Bells found
the last poultry somewhat tough and tasteless; whereupon I said that
our orders were more than we could possibly fill, still I hoped we could
go on &ldquo;selling them,&rdquo; as we never liked to part with old
customers, no matter how many new ones there were.&nbsp; Privately,
I understood the complaint only too well, for I knew the fowls in question
very intimately.&nbsp; Two of them were the runaway rooster and the
gadabout hen that never wanted to go to bed with the others.&nbsp; The
third was Cannibal Ann.&nbsp; I should have expected them to be tough,
but I cannot believe they were lacking in flavour.</p>
<p>The only troublesome feature of the trip was that Mrs. Sowerbutt&rsquo;s
lodgers had suddenly left for London and she was unable to take the
four rabbits as she had hoped; but as an offset to that piece of ill-fortune
the Coke and Coal Yard and the Bicycle Repairing Rooms came out into
the street, and, stepping up to the trap, requested regular weekly deliveries
of eggs and chickens, and hoped that I would be able to bring them myself.&nbsp;
And so, in a happy frame of mind, I turned out of the Buffington main
street, and was jogging along homeward, when a very startling thing
happened; namely, a whole verse of the Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter of Islington:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And as she went along the high road,<br />
The weather being hot and dry,<br />
She sat her down upon a green bank,<br />
And her true love came riding by.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That true lovers are given to riding by, in ballads, I know very
well, but I hardly supposed they did so in real life, especially when
every precaution had been taken to avert such a catastrophe.&nbsp; I
had told the Barbury Green postmistress, on the morning of my arrival,
not to give the Thornycroft address to anybody whatsoever, but finding,
as the days passed, that no one was bold enough or sensible enough to
ask for it, I haughtily withdrew my prohibition.&nbsp; About this time
I began sending envelopes, carefully addressed in a feigned hand, to
a certain person at the Oxenbridge Hydro.&nbsp; These envelopes contained
no word of writing, but held, on one day, only a bit of down from a
hen&rsquo;s breast, on another, a goose-quill, on another, a glossy
tail-feather, on another, a grain of corn, and so on.&nbsp; These trifles
were regarded by me not as degrading or unmaidenly hints and suggestions,
but simply as tests of intelligence.&nbsp; Could a man receive tokens
of this sort and fail to put two and two together?&nbsp; I feel that
I might possibly support life with a domineering and autocratic husband,&mdash;and
there is every prospect that I shall be called upon to do so,&mdash;but
not with a stupid one.&nbsp; Suppose one were linked for ever to a man
capable of asking,&mdash;&ldquo;Did <i>you</i> send those feathers?
. . . How was I to guess? . . . How was a fellow to know they came from
you? . . . What on earth could I suppose they meant? . . . What clue
did they offer me as to your whereabouts? . . . Am I a Sherlock Holmes?&rdquo;&mdash;No,
better eternal celibacy than marriage with such a being!</p>
<p>These were the thoughts that had been coursing through my goose-girl
mind while I had been selling dressed poultry, but in some way they
had not prepared me for the appearance of the aforesaid true love.</p>
<p>To see the very person whom one has left civilisation to avoid is
always more or less surprising, and to make the meeting less likely,
Buffington is even farther from Oxenbridge than Barbury Green.&nbsp;
The creature was well mounted (ominous, when he came to override my
caprice!) and he looked bigger, and, yes, handsomer, though that doesn&rsquo;t
signify, and still more determined than when I saw him last; although
goodness knows that timidity and feebleness of purpose were not in striking
evidence on that memorable occasion.&nbsp; I had drawn up under the
shade of a tree ostensibly to eat some cherries, thinking that if I
turned my face away I might pass unrecognised.&nbsp; It was a stupid
plan, for if I had whipped up the mare and driven on, he of course,
would have had to follow, and he has too much dignity and self-respect
to shriek recriminations into a woman&rsquo;s ear from a distance.</p>
<p>He approached with deliberation, reined in his horse, and lifted
his hat ceremoniously.&nbsp; He has an extremely shapely head, but I
did not show that the sight of it melted in the least the ice of my
resolve; whereupon we talked, not very freely at first,&mdash;men are
so stiff when they consider themselves injured.&nbsp; However, silence
is even more embarrassing than conversation, so at length I begin:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;It is a lovely day.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, but the drought is getting rather
oppressive, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;The crops certainly
need rain, and the feed is becoming scarce.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Are you a farmer&rsquo;s wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh no! that is a promotion
to look forward to; I am now only a Goose Girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Indeed!&nbsp; If I wished to be severe
I might remark: that I am sure you have found at last your true vocation!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;It was certainly through
no desire to please <i>you</i> that I chose it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;I am quite sure of that!&nbsp; Are
you staying in this part?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh no!&nbsp; I live
many miles distant, over an extremely rough road.&nbsp; And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;I am still at the Hydropathic; or
at least my luggage is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;It must be very pleasant
to attract you so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Not so pleasant as it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;No?&nbsp; A new proprietor,
I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;No; same proprietor; but the house
is empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i> (yawning purposely).&mdash;&ldquo;That
is strange; the hotels are usually so full at this season.&nbsp; Why
did so many leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;As a matter of fact, only one left.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Full&rsquo; and &lsquo;empty&rsquo; are purely relative terms.&nbsp;
I call a hotel full when it has you in it, empty when it hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i> (dying to laugh, but concealing her
feelings).&mdash;&ldquo;I trust my bulk does not make the same impression
on the general public!&nbsp; Well, I won&rsquo;t detain you longer;
good afternoon; I must go home to my evening work.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;I will accompany you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;If you are a gentleman
you will remain where you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;In the road?&nbsp; Perhaps; but if
I am a man I shall follow you; they always do, I notice.&nbsp; What
are those foolish bundles in the back of that silly cart?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Feed for the pony,
please, sir; fish for dinner; randans and barley meal for the poultry;
and four unsold rabbits.&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t you like them?&nbsp; Only
one and sixpence apiece.&nbsp; Shot at three o&rsquo;clock this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Thanks; I don&rsquo;t like mine shot
so early.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, well! doubtless
I shall be able to dispose of them on my way home, though times is &rsquo;ard!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Do you mean that you will &ldquo;peddle&rdquo;
them along the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;You understand me better
than usual,&mdash;in fact to perfection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dismounts and strides to the back of the cart, lifts the covers,
seizes the rabbits, flings some silver contemptuously into the basket,
and looks about him for a place to bury his bargain.&nbsp; A small boy
approaching in the far distance will probably bag the game.</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i> (modestly).&mdash;&ldquo;Thanks for
your trade, sir, rather ungraciously bestowed, and we &rsquo;opes for
a continuance of your past fyvors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i> (leaning on the wheel of the trap).&mdash;&ldquo;Let
us stop this nonsense.&nbsp; What did you hope to gain by running away?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Distance and absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;You knew you couldn&rsquo;t prevent
my offering myself to you sometime or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Perhaps not; but I
could at least defer it, couldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Why postpone the inevitable?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Doubtless I shrank
from giving you the pain of a refusal.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Perhaps; but do you know what I suspect?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a suspicious
person, thank goodness!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;That, on the contrary, you are wilfully
withholding from me the joy of acceptance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;If I intended to accept
you, why did I run away?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;To make yourself more desirable and
precious, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i> (with the most confident coquetry).&mdash;&ldquo;Did
I succeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;No; you failed utterly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i> (secretly piqued).&mdash;&ldquo;Then
I am glad I tried it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t succeed because
you were superlatively desirable and precious already; but you should
never have experimented.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know that Love is a high
explosive?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Is it?&nbsp; Then it
ought always to be labelled &lsquo;dangerous,&rsquo; oughtn&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; But who thought of suggesting matches?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;No such luck; I wish you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;According to your theory,
if you apply a match to Love it is likely to &lsquo;go off.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;I wish you would try it on mine and
await the result.&nbsp; Come now, you&rsquo;ll have to marry somebody,
sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;I confess I don&rsquo;t
see the necessity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i> (morosely).&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the sort of
woman men won&rsquo;t leave in undisturbed spinsterhood; they&rsquo;ll
keep on badgering you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind
the badgering of a number of men; it&rsquo;s rather nice.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
the one badger I find obnoxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i> (impatiently).&mdash;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the
perversity of things.&nbsp; I could put a stop to the protestations
of the many; I should like nothing better&mdash;but the pertinacity
of the one!&nbsp; Ah, well!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t drop that without putting
an end to my existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i> (politely).&mdash;&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
think of suggesting anything so extreme.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i> (quoting).&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Mrs. Hauksbee proceeded
to take the conceit out of Pluffles as you remove the ribs of an umbrella
before re-covering.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, you couldn&rsquo;t ask me
anything seriously that I wouldn&rsquo;t do, dear Mistress Perversity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i> (yielding a point).&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
put that boldly to the proof.&nbsp; Say you don&rsquo;t love me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i> (seizing his advantage).&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s imbecile and besotted devotion!&nbsp; Tell me, when may I
come to take you away?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i> (sighing).&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
like asking me to leave Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;I know it; she told me where to find
you,&mdash;Thornycroft is the seventh poultry-farm I&rsquo;ve visited,&mdash;but
you could never leave Heaven, you can&rsquo;t be happy without poultry,
why that is a wish easily gratified.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll get you a farm
to-morrow; no, it&rsquo;s Saturday, and the real estate offices close
at noon, but on Monday, without fail.&nbsp; Your ducks and geese, always
carrying it along with you.&nbsp; All you would have to do is to admit
me; Heaven is full of twos.&nbsp; If you shall swim on a crystal lake&mdash;Phoebe
told me what a genius you have for getting them out of the muddy pond;
she was sitting beside it when I called, her hand in that of a straw-coloured
person named Gladwish, and the ground in her vicinity completely strewn
with votive offerings.&nbsp; You shall splash your silver sea with an
ivory wand; your hens shall have suburban cottages, each with its garden;
their perches shall be of satin-wood and their water dishes of mother-of-pearl.&nbsp;
You shall be the Goose Girl and I will be the Swan Herd&mdash;simply
to be near you&mdash;for I hate live poultry.&nbsp; Dost like the picture?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a little like Claude Melnotte&rsquo;s, I confess.&nbsp; The
fact is I am not quite sane; talking with you after a fortnight of the
tabbies at the Hydro is like quaffing inebriating vodka after Miffin&rsquo;s
Food!&nbsp; May I come to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiffs Daughter</i> (hedging).&mdash;&ldquo;I shall be rather
busy; the Crossed Minorca hen comes off to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, never mind!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take
her off to-night when I escort you to the farm; then she&rsquo;ll get
a day&rsquo;s advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;And rob fourteen prospective
chicks of a mother; nay, lose the chicks themselves?&nbsp; Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;So long as you are a Goose Girl, does
it make any difference whose you are?&nbsp; Is it any more agreeable
to be Mrs. Heaven&rsquo;s Goose Girl than mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! but in one case
the term of service is limited; in the other, permanent.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;But in the one case you are the slave
of the employer, in the other the employer of the slave.&nbsp; Why did
you run away?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bailiff&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s mind
is too dull an instrument to measure a woman&rsquo;s reason; even my
own fails sometimes to deal with all its delicate shades; but I think
I must have run away chiefly to taste the pleasure of being pursued
and brought back.&nbsp; If it is necessary to your happiness that you
should explore all the Bluebeard chambers of my being, I will confess
further that it has taken you nearly three weeks to accomplish what
I supposed you would do in three days!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>True Love</i> (after a well-spent interval).&mdash;&ldquo;To-morrow,
then; shall we say before breakfast?&nbsp; All, do!&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp;
Well, then, immediately after breakfast, and I breakfast at seven nowadays,
and sometimes earlier.&nbsp; Do take off those ugly cotton gloves, dear;
they are five sizes too large for you, and so rough and baggy to the
touch!&rdquo;</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
